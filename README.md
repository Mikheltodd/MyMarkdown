# My Personal Markdown

This project is my personal repository for learning purposes about Markdown. Here, you can find some notes and basic information about Markdown (mainly related with codecademy content). 

A lot of useful resources have been shared and are focused on Markdown (really, a lot), but I just want to collect the ones that I think I'll be using most of the time (especially the [File Template](README_file_template.md)). 

Although I'm not still using the README file template (but I'm planning to), I encourage to use it for general purpose projects. The repository contains some Markdown Basics in a .txt file (most of if with basic snippets) and a jupyter notebook file with content taken from codecademy (pending on summarizing and modify for personal use). 

I also recommend to read tha article about how to write README files, which I refer to in [my personal notes](Markdown_Notes.md).

Thank you for reading this :grin:
