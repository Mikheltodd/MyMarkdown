    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a simple way to create visually appealing text documents without using any fancy editors, check out [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). Invented by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, Markdown provides a lightweight syntax to style any text document so that it can be converted to [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) for viewing and publishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between HTML and Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown translates to HTML, but Markdown is not a replacement for HTML. Markdown’s syntax can be converted to a small subset of HTML tags to do things like format text, add links, display images, and more. You can even incorporate HTML elements inside a Markdown document. To render Markdown in HTML, though, you would need a tool called a Markdown parser (more about this parser later on).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Using Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would you use Markdown? Compared to HTML, writing text in Markdown is much faster because the syntax is simpler. The [authors of Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) intended Markdown to be a language for writing styled text with syntax that is just as easy to read as it is to write. "

    "\n",
    "Contrary to popular belief, Markdown is not a document format. Therefore, it doesn’t require a strict file extension naming convention, such as .md. As the [official Markdown mailing list](https://superuser.com/questions/249436/file-extension-for-markdown-files) explains, Markdown isn’t meant to take over the format of a file. Any file extension that you would normally use to name your text document such as .txt or .text is appropriate. However, organizations such as [GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) have a preference to expect Markdown documents to appear with an .md or .markdown extension."

The original Markdown parser was written in Perl, but you can find parser [implementations](https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations) today in almost any programming language. Regardless, a basic Markdown parser should support the [core Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics): paragraphs, headers, blockquotes, phrase emphasis, lists, code, images, and links.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are Markdown parsers that are freely available on the Web: [StackEdit.io](https://stackedit.io/app#), [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/), [Parse](https://parsedown.org/demo) and [Markdown to HTML Converter](https://markdowntohtml.com/). In addition to parsing and rendering, both Parse and Markdown to HTML Converter also convert the Markdown document to raw HTML so that you can copy and paste the HTML to be used elsewhere."
