# Markdown Notes

Learning base: Codecademy Full Stack Path.

The following notes are taken from the article ["How to write a good README for your GitHub project?"](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project) by Rita Łyczywek:
* A README is the first file one should read when starting a new project. 
* It contains useful information
* It is a kind of manual
* A good README is for others to understand what our code includes, and why it's noteworthy.
* For Junior Devs, have in mind you may come back to the project and relaunch it. 
* For a budding programmer, GitHub is most often our portfolio. 
* Even a non-technical recruiter will be able to recognize the technologies we touched, and check if it goes in line with a candidate¿s profile. 
* Write it in English. 
* md: **markdown**
* Make sure the file **always includes**:
    * Titles and internal titles: explain clearly what you have (project name)
    * Introduction - the project's aim: it is like a summary. Shouldn'd be too long. What problems are you solving? If it is a training project, mention your incentive. Why did you crate it? To learn a particular technology? 
    * Technologies: write down the languages you used, libraries and versions. 
    * Launch: how to run the project and requirements.  
* Consider also using: 
    * Table of contents (should include the titles of sections, and - if necessary - the internal titles). Ti comes handy in case of extensive documentation. 
    * Illustrations: a technical documentation doesn't need to be pretty but... they can add aesthetical value to our project (logo, diagrams, schemes, screenshots)
    * Scope of functionalities: you can list features of your project
    * Examples of use: how to use your project (reusable code)
    * Project status: especially if the project is still being developed. Mention planned changes and  direction of development
    * Sources: add information when your project was based on a tutorial or got inspired by a given task. If your code is based on somebodys else's code, we should add such information. Mention what inspired you and what changes you made. 
    * Other information: author, conctact, www and social media links, a type of license under which the code is made available or the information on how to contribute to a project.
